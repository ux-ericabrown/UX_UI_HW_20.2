    <div class="projectOver">
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        When planning for travel, we can assume that the greatest deciding factor on almost every decision made is cost. People want to see the world without breaking the bank. In the midst of making travel plans, costs can start adding up, and anxiety around spending commitments can begin to rise. What if there was a simple and clear way to track your travel plans, and ensure you are receiving the greatest experiential return on your investment? BOOKED is a platform that transforms the travel planning experience. It is a travel management tool that exists right at your finger tips. As a customer, finding peace of mind when planning travel just takes three easy steps: download the app, set-up your account, and start planning your next trip.

        <b>Role:</b> UX/UI Design Lead
        <br>
        <b>Tools:</b> Adobe XD and Illustrator, InVision, Pen & Paper
        <br>
        <b>Time Period:</b>> 2 Weeks, Individual Project
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Research/User Interviews</h3>
      <p>To kick things off, I began by identifying the goal for this research: what paint points and problems do people experience while planning travel? I identified biases and compiled a research plan with a focus on how people are traveling. What is motivating them? What makes them feel safe in not only where they’re going, but also in the decisions they’re making? What actions are they taking to feel confident in their travel decisions? The information gathered from five 1-1 interviews and 40 survey responses revealed a number of helpful insights.
        <br><br>
        <b>Key Takeaways:</b><br>
        <ul class="userKeys">
          <li class="userItem">Users typically travel with others / rarely travel solo.</li>
          <li class="userItem">Users are using reward systems to travel. They find importance in being rewarded for spending time and money. Rewards are a major motivator in flight and lodging decisions.</li class="userItem">
          <li class="userItem">Users are overwhelmed by coordinating multiple places and itineraries. They do not find this process simple or straightforward. There are an abundance of options to choose from.</li class="userItem">
          <li class="userItem">Users are frustrated by how difficult it is to share plans or ideas with others involved.</li class="userItem">
          <li class="userItem">Users are not necessarily loyal to one source when it comes to planning travel experiences. They are however, seemingly dedicated to one flight carrier and whether or not they’ll stay in a hotel or an AirBnb.</li class="userItem">
          <li class="userItem">Users mentioned pain in coordinating travel logistics within each location / trip. AKA how they are getting from point A to B.</li class="userItem">
          <li class="userItem">Users value customer service.</li class="userItem">
          <li class="userItem">Biggest concerns are be budget, clarity on locations with tougher logistics, and getting the most for their money.</li class="userItem">
          <li class="userItem">Dislikes: hidden fees, long travel days, lack of coordination and collaboration, unclear logistics. </li class="userItem">
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>In conclusion, there were many concerns about budget and squeezing activities into the allotted amount of time for a trip. Users struggled with comparing costs for different activities across a number of different platforms. And, there is added stress around “time-pressure” – getting to the airport / waiting for the flight or throughout the trip. Users struggle to track down local activities and find it to be a huge undertaking to get everyone involved on one set plan. Users enjoy sightseeing, experiencing local cuisine / shops, and doing things outdoors the most and they are motivated to travel to experience new things, to visit friends/family, to get away from work / life at home – to do things they can’t do at home.</p>

      <h3>User Persona</h3>
      <p>Following the interviews, I created the user persona, Lexi Greene, to visually convey the insights that were gathered from the research. This persona allowed me to stay focused on who the platform’s potential user is, what their needs/goals are, and gave me the space to keep the human-factor front and center of all thinking and design decisions.</p>

      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>This product is designed to deliver a simply, enjoyable, and collaborative group travel planning experience. We observed that users are overwhelmed by the process of planning group travel and don’t feel there is a source for seamless management of travel plans and logistics. How might we encourage participation and organization so that our users are able to make confident decisions and feel they are getting the most from the time and money investment of traveling?</p>

          <h3>Centers for Disease Control</h3>
          <p>
            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is an essential resource for up-to-date information on all things as it relates to health, disease, travel, and more. It is vital that users can easily navigate this information for quick and reliable updates. Over the course of a few weeks, I was challenged to reimagine the CDC website. I analyzed the user experience and UI elements, addressed strengths and weaknesses through interviews and a competitor analysis, and produced a solution that bridges the gap between the CDC’s mission, user experience, and visual appeal.
